## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional job boards show roles **after** companies have been searching for months. By then:
- The best opportunities are gone
- Competition is fierce  
- Companies are desperate (red flag)

**Senior designers need to find opportunities EARLY**, when companies are just starting to hire.

---

## 💡 Solution

MINA uses **You.com's multi-API suite** to detect hiring signals at Series A/B/C startups:

1. **News API** → Recent funding announcements
2. **Search API** → Company information & context
3. **Express API** → AI-powered insights

Instead of searching for jobs, MINA searches for **signals that companies are hiring**.
