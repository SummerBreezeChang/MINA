# MINA - Startup Career Scout

> Find design roles at Series A/B/C startups before they hit job boards

An intelligent career search platform powered by **You.com's Search API** that discovers hiring signals at early-stage startups through funding announcements.

**Built for You.com Agentic AI Hackathon 2025**

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional job boards show roles **2-3 months after** companies start hiring. By then:
- ❌ The best opportunities are gone
- ❌ Competition is fierce
- ❌ Hiring managers are desperate (red flag)

**Designers need to find opportunities EARLY** - when companies just got funded and are starting to hire.

---

## 💡 The Solution

MINA uses **You.com's Search API** to detect hiring signals at Series A/B/C startups by finding:

- 💰 **Funding announcements** - Companies that just raised money
- 📊 **Series A/B/C filtering** - Only early-stage startups
- 📍 **Location-based search** - Find local opportunities
- 🤖 **Smart parsing** - Extract company names and funding details

Instead of searching for jobs, MINA searches for **signals that companies are hiring**.
