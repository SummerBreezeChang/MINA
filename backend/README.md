## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wildhash/Mina.git
cd Mina
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys
```

4. Set up your API keys (all optional for testing):
   - **Anthropic API key** from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) - For Claude AI
   - **Browser Use API key** from [cloud.browser-use.com](https://cloud.browser-use.com/) - For web scraping ($10 free credits)
   - **Daytona API key** from [daytona.io](https://www.daytona.io/) - For sandbox execution ($200 free credits)
   - **Galileo API key** from [galileo.ai](https://www.galileo.ai/) - For observability
   - Add all keys to your `.env` file

**Note**: Mina works without API keys using mock data and fallback mechanisms for testing/development.

## Usage

### Quick Demo

Run the integration demo to see all features:

```bash
python demo_integrations.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Browser Use integration (with fallback to mock data)
- Daytona sandbox execution (with fallback to direct processing)
- Galileo observability (with @log decorators)
- Claude AI analysis (with fallback to rule-based)
- Async workflow for efficient parallel operations

### Command Line Interface

Run Mina interactively from the command line:

```bash
python mina_cli.py
```

The agent will guide you through:
1. Selecting a product category
2. Specifying your budget and priorities
3. Reviewing research results
4. Understanding recommendations with confidence scores

### Programmatic Usage

Use Mina in your Python code:

```python
import asyncio
from mina_agent import MinaAgent

async def find_laptop():
    agent = MinaAgent()
    
    # Async workflow (recommended)
    recommendations = await agent.research_product_async(
        category="laptop",
        budget=3000,
        priorities=["Performance", "Battery Life"]
    )
    
    # Display results
    agent.present_recommendations(recommendations)

asyncio.run(find_laptop())
```

### Example Session

```
Welcome to Mina - Your AI Shopping Concierge
============================================================

I help you make confident decisions on high-end purchases ($500+)
by researching products, analyzing reviews, and providing
transparent recommendations with confidence scores.

What type of product are you looking to purchase?
1. Laptop
2. Furniture
3. Appliance

Enter your choice (1-3): 1

============================================================
Great! Let's find the perfect laptop for you.
============================================================

What's your maximum budget? ($): 3000

What are your top priorities? (You can select multiple)
1. Performance
2. Battery Life
3. Display Quality
4. Portability
5. Build Quality

Enter priority numbers (comma-separated, e.g., 1,3,4): 1,2,5

...
```

## Supported Product Categories

### Laptops
- Performance comparison
- Battery life analysis
- Display quality assessment
- Build quality evaluation
- Price-to-performance ratios

### Furniture

## Confidence Score Methodology

Mina uses a multi-factor approach with Galileo observability to calculate confidence scores:

- **Customer Ratings (25%)**: Verified buyer ratings and review sentiment
- **Requirements Fit (40%)**: How well the product matches your stated priorities
- **Review Confidence (20%)**: Volume and consistency of reviews
- **Data Completeness (15%)**: Availability of comprehensive specifications

Scores range from 0-100%, with higher scores indicating greater confidence in the recommendation.

All scoring steps are logged via Galileo's @log decorators for full transparency and traceability.

## Development

```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run core unit tests
python test_mina.py

# Run integration tests
python test_integrations.py

# Or use pytest for both
pip install pytest pytest-cov
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. tests/
```

### Integration Testing

Each integration can be tested independently:

```python
# Test Browser Use
agent = MinaAgent()
assert agent.browser is not None or agent.browser is None  # Works with or without API key

# Test Daytona
result = agent.analyze_in_sandbox([{"test": "data"}])
assert "products" in result

# Test Galileo decorators
@log(span_type="workflow")
def my_function():
    pass  # Automatically traced when Galileo configured
```
